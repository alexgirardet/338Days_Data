# 338Days_Data
This is my 338 day learning journey in AI, Maths, and Data Engineering.

## Motivation
Growing up with ADHD, I struggled to excel academically despite maintaining average grades. However, being freed from the constraints of formal education allowed me to explore my own learning style and interests. Despite not having a background in STEM, during the first COVID-19 lockdown, I discovered my passion for coding and data science. I have since been working as a data engineer, which has solidified my desire to pursue a career in this industry. The emergence of innovative technologies like ChatGPT has only increased my motivation to dive deeper into the field of AI. The 338 day data challenge serves as an opportunity for me to continue to grow and improve my skills in a field that I am passionate about. This challenge is a personal milestone that I am eager to achieve through determination and hard work. It serves as a reminder to myself and others that, even with learning challenges, one can pursue their passions and achieve success in their chosen field.


## Strategy
My goal is to become proficient in data engineering, machine learning engineering, and to leverage my finance and business background to gain a deeper understanding of creating and managing data-driven organizations.

To accomplish this goal, the challenge will consist of several feats including:

* Reading and summarizing 11 books (1 per month)
* Completing 4 projects (1 per quarter)
* Participating in 2 bootcamps
* 3 Certificates
* Reading and summarizing 48 research papers (1 per week)
* Writing 48 articles (1 per week)

I recognize that working a full-time job will make this challenge more difficult, but it also provides me with the added benefit of being immersed in the world of tech and surrounded by those who are more proficient in these areas, from whom I can learn. I plan to use the techniques and tools outlined by Tiago Forte's [Building a Second Brain](https://github.com/alexandergirardet/Book_Summaries/blob/main/Building_a_Second_Brain.pdf) for my time management, note-taking, and information organization strategy to help me stay on track.
